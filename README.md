# Assignment

Evaluation Test for Quality Assurance Engineer

This assignment demonstrates a Cypress test automation framework using the Page Object Model (POM) approach to verify specific styling changes on a web page.

Changes Made
Font: Updated the font of heading 1 (<h1>).
Font Size: Increased the font size.
Font Color: Changed the color of heading 1 text.

Approach
The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM), where all page interactions are handled in separate Page Object files. Test data is driven by fixture files for flexibility, and common commands are stored in the commands folder for reusability.

Running the Tests
To run the tests locally, clone the repository, and open Cypress using npx cypress open. Select and run the test file to verify the changes.
